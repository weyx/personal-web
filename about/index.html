						Hello, I am Ziko Riandi a student at Universitas Internasional Batam.
						I am majoring in information systems. Before studying at UIB, I went
						to a vocational high school majoring in computer and network
						engineering.

					<p>
						Becoming a programmer is my goal so, I am focusing on programming. I
						used to dislike programming but, I challenged myself to do it anyway
						and enjoy the journey. The language that I take up is C#, ASP, and
						Javascript.

					<p>
						I can also design UI/UX. Well-grounded working as a team or
						individually. Visit my team's project where I'm in charge of
						designing. Aside from UI/UX, I also design content for Instagram in an
						organization. Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma are my go-to weapons
						for designing.<br> Picture is clickable ☛

					<p>
						Confident in hardware, I repair computers, printers, and similar
						devices as a side hustle. I learned about hardware during high school,
						where I got an internship in Origami. There I am responsible for tech
						support in several offices to do maintenance.

					<p>
						May not look like one, but I'm a nerd. Reading books is how I spend my
						free time. Non-fictional book is my favorite book. By non-fictional, I
						mean books that talk about self-development. I'm reading the book
						"deep work" by Cal Newport when I type this if I have time to spare.
					</p>

					<p>
						Other than being a geek and a nerd, a leader is also what I'm
						pursuing. Reading books about leadership and public speaking is one of
						my few efforts to learn leadership. It might still be far away and I
						still have a lot to learn, but hope one day I can lead an amazing team
						and accomplish my goals.
